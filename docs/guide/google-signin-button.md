# Google Sign-in Button

Adding Google Sign-in button anywhere can be done using the provided `GoogleSignInButton` component imported from `vue3-google-signin`.
This button is rendered by google using their branding guidelines.

::: tip
This component is also globally availiable with `GoogleSignInButton` after plugin initialization.

::: info
If you want a custom button go to the following [page](/guide/creating-custom-buttons.md)

## Using Google Sign In button

To use the button we can simply import it or use global component as per in above. 
For better IDE support we are going to import it.

<<< @/guide/snippets/google-signin-button/snippet.vue

And the result is the following button rendered on your page.

<script setup lang="ts">
// handle success event
const handleLoginSuccess = (response) => {
  console.log("Login successful", response);
  const { credential } = response
  console.log("Access Token", credential);
};

// handle an error event
const handleLoginError = () => {
  console.error("Login failed");
};
</script>

<ClientOnly>
<div class="demo" :style="{ 'color-scheme': 'auto' }">
  <GoogleSignInButton
    @success="handleLoginSuccess"
    @error="handleLoginError"
  ></GoogleSignInButton>
</div>
</ClientOnly>

You can checkout the console for the output.

::: tip
If you have a weird white box around the button generated by Google, thats propbably due to a conflict with color scheme.
To overcome this use `color-scheme: auto` CSS attribute.
